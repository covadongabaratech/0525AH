90#VERS#COMMENT##: In some pages, a part of the text is missing and the
    footnotes are mixed with the text. Sometimes the footnotes appear after //, but
    sometimes there is no systematic way to split them off (some of such pages have
    a better condition in the JK version, but not all of them).
